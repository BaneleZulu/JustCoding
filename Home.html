                                Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language
                                used to create complete applications. The language is
                                platform independent, allowing it to run on any device
                                that supports its environment.In terms of growth relative
                                to the market, demand for top-ranked Java is actually
                                growing slightly slower than the market. But Java still
                                leads second-ranked Python by a strong margin. Its
                                first-place ranking is secure for the foreseeable future.

                                Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose
                                programming language, and one of the most popular
                                languages for rapid development. Python usage is
                                widespread, with companies including Intel, IBM, Netflix,
                                and Meta using the language. Demand for Python is catching
                                up to demand for Java. While Java is growing slower than
                                the market, Python grew relative to the market. While
                                Python’s growth may mean that it narrows Java’s lead, the
                                wide gap between them means we’re unlikely to see any
                                place-trading.

                                SQL is an industry-standard structured query language for
                                creating, defining, implementing, accessing, and
                                maintaining relational databases. In 2022, demand for SQL
                                grew at a steady rate and managed to surpass C++. It’s
                                also growing faster relative to the market. But while SQL
                                improved its demand ranking, it decreased in its
                                popularity ranking. SQL’s third-place demand ranking is
                                noticeably higher than its sixth-place popularity ranking.
                                The source of this gap in supply and demand is unclear.
                                Interest in the SQL vs NoSQL debate has risen steadily
                                over the last decade. Developers turning toward
                                non-relational database systems could be a contributing
                                factor.

                                C++ is a general purpose, compiled, and statically typed
                                programming language. Known as “C with Classes,” C++ is an
                                extension of C with the functionality of user-defined data
                                classes. The high performance of C++ has made it the top
                                language for use cases requiring fast rendering, including
                                browsers, banking applications, and motion design
                                software. In 2022, C++ fell from third to fourth place,
                                overtaken by SQL’s steady growth rate. Demand for C++ is
                                also growing slightly slower relative to the market.
                                However, demand for the language isn’t going anywhere. C++
                                skills are vital for maintaining existing applications and

                                Primarily used for building interactive web experiences,

                                our list. At fifth place, JavaScript has nearly four times
                                the volume of the sixth-ranked Bash. This calls attention
                                to an important characteristic of this demand-based
                                ranking. After the top five, there is a huge gap in
                                volume, placing the leading programming languages in a
                                category of their own. While JavaScript is growing
                                slightly slower than the market, its top-five ranking is
                                secure.

                                Bash is a command-line language for Unix operating
                                systems. The language allows developers (or anyone who
                                works with data) to work with computer files directly
                                instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). This
                                makes it a useful skill to learn for cloud engineers and
                                data scientists. Bash stands out on our list as the only
                                in-demand language that did not rank in popularity with
                                developers. It will be interesting to see how this
                                misalignment between supply and demand will affect the job
                                market. Will an abundance of opportunity and demand
                                inspire developers to learn the language? Or will a small
                                talent pool of developers skilled in the language force
                                employers to pay a premium for their skills? In 2020 Bash
                                was already correlated with higher compensation than
                                popular languages like C, C++, C#, Python, and Java.

                                C++, Java, and JavaScript. Demand for C# sits in the
                                middle of the language family. C++ far exceeds C# in

                                since launch it’s evolved into a general-purpose language
                                used in a wide range of applications. Go has been gaining

                                popularity is translating into hiring demand. Demand for
                                Go grew by 301% in 2022. One potential side effect of Go’s
                                success is that it might affect the growth of larger
                                languages. Developers looking to learn a new
                                general-purpose language might start choosing Go over
                                languages with weak demand. (We’re looking at you, Ruby.)
                                It will be interesting to see if Go has the momentum to
                                challenge the rankings of other languages on our list.
                                While demand for Go is growing at 140% relative to the
                                market, C# is only growing at 10% relative to the market.
                                Though momentum is on Go’s side, the gap between the two
                                languages might be too large to overcome in just a few
                                years.

                                TypeScript is an open-source, object-oriented language
                                that is an extension of JavaScript. Developed by Microsoft
                                in 2012, TypeScript describes itself as “all of
                                JavaScript, and then a bit more.” TypeScript has been
                                gaining popularity for years, and ranked 4th in GitHub’s
                                2022 language rankings. Like Go, we’re seeing that
                                popularity translate into hiring demand. At 392%,
                                TypeScript had the highest growth in demand of any
                                programming language. It will be interesting to see how
                                TypeScript’s growth will affect JavaScript. The two are
                                tightly linked. TypeScript’s growth could come at the
                                expense of JavaScript, or it could serve to amplify it.

                                R is an open-source programming language for statistical
                                computing and data analysis. Researchers and scientists
                                use R for data visualization and statistical analysis in a
                                number of industries, including academia, research,
                                fintech, retail, government, healthcare, and social media.
                                While it ranks low on our list, demand for R is growing.
                                At about 60% relative to the market, it posted the
                                fifth-highest growth in demand. What’s interesting is that
                                growing employer demand for R is misaligned with its
                                falling popularity with developers. From 2021 to 2022, R
                                dropped from the thirteenth to the fifteenth most popular
                                language – dead last on our list. And while R grew by 59%
                                in 2022, most other languages we ranked grew two to four
                                times faster. How will this conflict between supply and
                                demand play out in the job market? Like Bash, we’ll be
                                watching closely to see if growing demand inspires
                                developer interest or raises the compensation for R
                                skills.

                                PHP is a widely-used open source and general-purpose
                                scripting language that is especially suited for web
                                development. PHP’s popularity is owed to the fact that it
                                was one of the first server-side languages that developers
                                could embed into HTML. While demand for PHP is low
                                compared to other general-purpose languages, its growth
                                rate is actually quite high. Demand for PHP grew at about
                                180% relative to the market, making it the second
                                fastest-growing language, surpassed only by TypeScript.
                                PHP might have enough momentum to challenge R and break
                                into the top ten. PHP’s volume is only slightly lower than
                                R’s, but it’s growing about three times faster relative to
                                the market. This rise in demand may help correct PHP’s
                                lagging compensation, which Stack Overflow ranked second
                                to last in 2020 and 2021.

                                C is a general-purpose, statically-typed, and compiled
                                programming language. A foundational programming language,
                                C has become known as the mother of all languages. While
                                it ranks low on our list – third to last – demand for C is
                                still growing. At about 70% relative to the market, C
                                posted the fourth-highest growth rate out of any language.
                                While it doesn’t have the volume or growth to surpass PHP
                                in the near future, its place is secure against the two
                                struggling languages that appear next on our list.

                                language with a focus on performance, safety, and design
                                patterns. Created by Apple to replace Objective-C, Swift
                                is the go-to language for Mac, iPhone, and iPad iOS
                                development. In 2022, Swift had the second-largest
                                decrease in demand. Its volume in 2022 was only 80% of
                                what it was in 2021. Swift’s popularity is also limited,
                                demonstrated by its drop from nine to ten in our list on
                                language popularity. Taking both of these figures into
                                account, we can see that Swift is in a state of decline.
                                This can be attributed to the fact that Swift never quite
                                caught on as a general-purpose language, and has had to
                                settle for specialization in iOS development.

                                Ruby is an interpreted, dynamic, open-source programming
                                language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. Ruby
                                has a diverse range of use cases, including data-driven
                                web apps, marketplaces, and desktop apps. In 2020 Ruby
                                ranked fifth in Stack Overflow’s list of highest paying
                                programming languages. But despite high compensation,
                                demand for Ruby is declining. Its demand in 2022 was only
                                66% of what it posted in 2021. It’s also growing the
                                slowest relative to the market out of any language on our
                                list. Developers have gradually shifted away from Ruby
                                over the past several years, and it’s not surprising to
                                find its demand fading as well. Ruby is already dead last
                                in demand. If it continues at this rate, another language
                                will inevitably take its place.

                                        Programming is a skill that is in high demand in many
                                        industries and fields, and it can also be a fun and
                                        rewarding hobby. Programming can help you create
                                        innovative solutions, automate tasks, analyze data, and
                                        express your creativity. According to some sources,
                                        programming is not obsolete, but rather evolving with the
                                        advances in technology and AI. Therefore, learning to code
                                        is still valuable, but it may require adapting to the
                                        changing trends and expectations in the tech industry.

                                        Even if an AI is developed that can produce perfectly
                                        working software doing exactly what people ask for, the
                                        problem is that people generally don't know what they need
                                        and aren't good at communicating it even when they do
                                        know. If AIs become good enough at generating code, then
                                        programmers will adapt to focus on analyzing requirements,
                                        writing specifications, communicating that clearly to the
                                        AIs, checking their output and integrating that into the
                                        larger tech stack or vision. However, AIs won't be
                                        producing perfect code anytime soon since they're being
                                        trained on human code, which is full of bugs and
                                        vulnerabilities.

                                the Internet or an intranet. It
                                involves both technical and creative aspects, such as <b>coding</b>,

                                <b>design</b>, <b>User Interface</b>, and <b>user experience</b>.
                                Web developers use various languages and tools, such as <b>HTML</b>, <b>CSS</b>,
                                <b>JavaScript</b>, and <b>HTTP</b>, to create web

                                industry, and has most of the highest paying jobs in IT.
